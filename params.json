  "body": "This web application is a simple logistics tool to help employees in the receiving and shipping unit of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.\r\n\r\nBLT2 allows users to submit important information about packages such as tracking number, date received and packing slip images to a database, allow users in the main office to view package information submitted on a given date, and provides a list of packages for the users for when they are out delivering packages to the receivers.\r\n\r\nGiven the amount of packages delivered daily to the Biochemistry department, this web application serves as a 'middleman', along with the employees in the shipping and receiving unit, between the packages delivered and their receivers. BLT2 also works along side with the Biochemistry Purchasing System (BPS) as it stores the location of packing slips in the database so that employees in the office can verify purchase orders to packages delivered.\r\n\r\nBLT2 is not tied to the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Anyone can use the web application on their own web server using their own database to store their own information about incoming packages to their own department. BLT2 is released under the MIT license and can be modified to whatever fits your department.",
