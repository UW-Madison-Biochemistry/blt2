Biochemistry Logistics Tool 2 (BLT2)
====================================

This web application is a simple logistics tool to help employees in the receiving and shipping unit of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

BLT allows users to submit important information about packages received at the shipping dock to a database, allows users in the main office to view package information submitted on a given date, and provides a list for of packages for the users for when they are out delivering packages to the labs.

Given the amount of packages delivered daily to the Biochemistry department, this web application serves as a 'middleman', along with the employees in the shipping and receiving department, between the packages delivered and the labs it's suppose to go to. BLT also works along side with the Biochemistry Purchasing System (BPS) as it stores the location of packing slips in the database so that employees in the office can verify purchase orders to packages delivered.
